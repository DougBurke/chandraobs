    <h2>Exposure times: what exposure times?</h2>

    <p>
      This is an <em>experimental</em> view of the exposure times
      of the Science observations made by Chandra. That is, how
      long does Chandra spend observing a target in a single
      observation, rather than a look at how much time is spent
      on each target. I may well switch to a histogram view, but
      the cumulative view means I don't have to think about a
      sensible binning scheme.
      The data used is for all the data shown in the
      <a href="/search/calendar">calendar view</a>, and is
      split by proposal cycle, as well as there being one curve
      for all the data (the dotted line).
    </p>

    <p>
      The Cycle 13 results are different because there
      are not many observations from this cycle in this data set.
      It's not so immediately clear to me why the Cycle 17 curve
      is so different; it is also not complete, but I am not convinced
      that's the explanation (although the more I look at it, the more
      I think it might be a significant contributor).
