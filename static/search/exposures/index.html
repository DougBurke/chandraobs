    <h2>Exposure times: what exposure times?</h2>

    <p>
      This is an <em>experimental</em> view of the exposure times
      of the Science observations made by Chandra. That is, how
      long does Chandra spend observing a target in a single
      observation, rather than a look at how much time is spent
      on each target. I may well switch to a histogram view, but
      the cumulative view means I don't have to think about a
      sensible binning scheme. I also need to tweak the X axis
      to display in hours rather than kilo-seconds: 100 kiloseconds
      is almost 28 hours.
    </p>

    <p>
      The data used is for all the data shown in the
      <a href="/search/calendar">calendar view</a>, and is
      split by proposal cycle, as well as there being one curve
      for all the data. I am not going to tell you what the colors
      mean as I haven't coded that up yet, so don't know myself.
      I <em>can</em> tell you that the dotted line is for all the
      data, and that hovering over one line will highlight it.
    </p>

    <p>
      I think the two curves which are significantly different to
      the rest are for cycles for which I do not have a lot of
      data. A legend would help clear this up!
