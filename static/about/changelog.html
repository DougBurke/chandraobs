	 As a post-Valentine's gift, the
         <a href="../about/views.html#WWT">"Interactive" view</a>
	 now shows <strong>all</strong> Chandra observations
	 that are in the database. A "Hide other FOVs" button
	 has been added to allow you to toggle their display,
	 since it can be distracting in highly-observed areas,
	 such as near
	 <a href="/search/name?target=M31">M31</a>
	 or the
	 <a href="/search/name?target=SGR%20A%2a">Galactic Center</a>.

       <p>
	 A pre-Valentine's present to you all: the
         <a href="../about/views.html#WWT">"Interactive" view</a>
	 of an observation now shows the location of other
	 Chandra observations taken nearby (assuming you
	 don't pick a "<a href='https://twitter.com/doug_burke/status/1095480817764233217'>lonely source</a>").
	 Please expect some tweaks to the interface, such as the
	 ability to hide these other observations, in the coming
	 days.

         There have been significant enhancements to the
         <a href="../about/views.html#WWT">"Interactive" view</a>
         of an observation (which uses the
         <a href="http://www.worldwidetelescope.org/webclient/">WorldWide
           Telescope</a> web client). You can now select the
         background image (the default is still from the
         Digitized Sky Survey, but several wavebands spanning from
         long (Cosmic Microwave Background) to short (Gamma ray)
         wavelengths. An option to toggle the display of the
         constellations and the boundaries of the constellations
         has also been aded. As a final note, the area showing these
         options can be minimised, or dragged around the WWT display,
         if it gets in your way.

         Scrolling in the
         <a href="../about/views.html#WWT">"Interactive" view</a>
         of an observation, which uses the
         <a href="http://www.worldwidetelescope.org/webclient/">WorldWide
           Telescope</a> web client, now no-longer
         causes the whole page to scroll, which makes zooming into or
         out of the image a lot nicer. Apologies that it took so long
         to solve this niggle!

         The coverage of the early part of the mission has been improved,
         with the first entry now mid-August of 1999, as well as filling
         some gaps in the database. The coverage can be seen on the
         <a href="../search/calendar/">calendar view</a>.

     </dd>
     
     <dt>August 26 2017</dt>
     <dd>
       <p>
         The proposal abstracts for virtually all of the proposals
         have been added. At present they are only available from
         the proposal page - for example the page about the
         <a href="/proposal/18700442">Extreme rotation measures
           and high-redshift clusters</a> proposal - but more
         visualizations (such as the obligatory word cloud),
         and search functionality, are planned.
       </p>
     </dd>

     <dt>August 3 2017</dt>
     <dd>
       <p>
         The "Details" view now provides a link to the schedule
         of all observations in that Cycle.
       </p>
     </dd>

     <dt>August 2 2017</dt>
     <dd>
       <p>
         The links to the previous and next observations on the
         <a href="/">main page</a>
         have hopefully been made more obvious.
       </p>
     </dd>

     <dt>July 22 2017</dt>
     <dd>
       <p>
         The links to the different <a href="views.html">views</a> of
         an observation have been changed to be a bit-more informative;
         they now say "Optical", "X-ray (RASS)", "X-ray (PSPC)", and
         "Interactive" rather than "DSS", "RASS", "PSPC", and "WWT".
       </p>
     </dd>

     <dt>July 20 2017</dt>
     <dd>
       <p>
         Added a <a href="index.html#database">database section</a>
         to the about page. This currently lists the time the database
         was last updated and a brief summary of the size of the
         database, but will hopefully soon contain some more background
         information.
       </p>
     </dd>

     <dt>July 17 2017</dt>
     <dd>
       <p>
         Reduced the time taken to create the data needed for the
         <a href="/search/timeline">timeline view</a> of the
         database. More work is needed as you still have to wait too
         long for the data to download.
       </p>
     </dd>

     <dt>July 15 2017</dt>
     <dd>
       <p>
         Included the text of the proposal abstracts, taken from the
         rather useful
         <a href="http://ads.harvard.edu/">SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data
           System</a> (it is the go-to service for Astronomers searching
         the Astronomical literature). This text - if available - is
         included in the "Proposal view"; an example is
         <a href="/proposal/5800713">A detailed Chandra study of the
           luminous lensing cluster MS2137.3-2353</a>. Unfortunately
         I have not been able to match up all observations, in particular
         recent observations are not matched.
       </p>

       <p>
         The link to the optical and X-ray <a href="views.html">views
           of an observation</a> have been fixed for observations with
         a value (ObsId) less than 10000. Note that very-early observations
         are still broken (in that the images will not display).
       </p>
     </dd>

     <dt>July 8 2017</dt>
     <dd>
       <p>
         Reduced the download time for some of the
         more-complex <a href="/search/">search results</a> - such as
         viewing <a href="/search/instrument/ACIS-I">all the ACIS-I
           observations</a>. There are still improvements to make!
       </p>
     </dd>

     <dt>July 1 2017</dt>
     <dd>
       <p>
         The view of the actual Chandra data for an observation (once
         it is public), on both the observation page and in the timeline
         view, has been disabled as it was causing an unexpected burden
         on the Chandra Data Archive. It will be added back once we have
         come up with a less-disruptive scheme.
       </p>
     </dd>

     <!-- missing some speed improvements, but I'm mentally bundling them
          into the July 8 section -->

     <dt>June 28 2017</dt>
     <dd>
       <p>
         The <a href="/search/exposures/">exposure-time breakdown page</a>
         has been cleaned up slightly: the proposal cycles are now listed
         in numerical order (they were in a somewhat-random order before)
         and a table listing the breakdown of total exposure-time per
         cycle has been added. As a by-product of this there is now a
         per-cycle view of the observations, such as everyone's favourite
         <a href="/search/cycle/07">Cycle 7</a>.
       </p>

       <p>
         The documentation has been updated to reflect the fact that the
         database has now been filled up with data back to the
         <a href="/search/calendar/">start of the mission</a>
         (unfortunately it's not complete, in
         particular the early observations are currently missing).
       </p>

       <p>
         Some minor speed improvements have been applied, since the
         addition of all the historical data was stressing the
         design. More improvements are to come!
