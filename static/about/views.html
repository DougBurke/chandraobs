   <p><strong>TODO:</strong> add example images.</p>

   <p>
     We provide five views of the science observations:

   <dl>
    <dt>DSS</dt>
    <dd>
     <p>
       This shows the 
       <a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/dss/">STScI Digitized Sky Survey</a>
       image of the sky surrounding the target.
       These images are scans of observations of the night sky made
       with small (for modern standard) telescopes using
       photographic plates; they therefore represent a good
       representation of the night sky you would see if your
       eyes were <em>extremely</em> sensitive.
       Please see the 
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digitized_Sky_Survey">Wikipedia
	 article on Digitized Sky Surveys</a> for more information.

       This shows the 
       <a href="http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/rosat/rass.html">ROSAT All Sky Survey data</a>
       available for the area.
       This survey was made by the
       ROSAT satellite - a German-led mission - which 
       covered 
       <a href="http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/cgi-bin/rosat/rosat-survey">virtually all the sky</a>
       using an
       X-ray imaging detector. This detector
       was only sensitive to "soft" X-rays -
       roughly 0.1 to 2.5 keV - and had a significantly
       worse
       <abbr title="Point Spread Function">PSF</abbr>
       than Chandra.
     </p>
    </dd>

    <dt>PSPC</dt>
    <dd>
     <p>
       This shows the ROSAT 
       <abbr title="Position Sensitive Proportional Counter">PSPC</abbr>
       data available
       for the area, taken from the "pointed
       phase" of the Observatory's lifetime.
       Since this did not cover the whole sky,
       regions may contain no data, or the
       data only partly covers the image.
       if present, the data is generally of 
       "higher quality" than the All-Sky-Survey
       data since the observation times are generally
       significantly longer than, and the 
       <abbr title="Point Spread Function">PSF</abbr>
       size is smaller than, the 
       <abbr title="ROSAT All Sky Survey">RASS</abbr>.
     </p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Details</dt>
    <dd>
     <p>
       A list of the observation details is displayed;
       this includes more information than provided by
       default, and is considered an "expert" view.
     </p>
    </dd>

    <dt>WWT</dt>
    <dd>
     <p>
       The 
       <abbr title="World Wide Telescope">WWT</abbr>
       link shows the approximate
       field of view of the observation using the
       HTML5 version of Microsoft's
       <a href="http://www.worldwidetelescope.org/">World Wide
	 Telescope</a> - aka WWT - service.
       It only provides a small subset of the
       features of the

	 HTML5 web client</a>.
