   <h1>Viewing the observation</h1>

   <p>
     We provide five or siz views of the science observations:
   </p>

   <dl>
    <dt id="Chandra">Chandra</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>
        This view is only shown when the Chandra data for the observation
        has been made publically available. This generally means that the
        observation was taken long-enough ago that the embargo period
        has passed (this is a one-year period after the observation was
        taken that the data is only available to the proposing Scientist,
        so that they can analyze the results and write up one or more
        papers), although some observations become public immediately.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Chandra images are created to provide a "quick look" at the
        data for the observers, and is not going to look as visually stunning
        as those released on the
        <a href="http://chandra.si.edu/photo/">Chandra Photo Album</a>,
        or press releases from other satellites such as the Hubble or
        Spitzer Space Telescopes.
        They can also show a number of instrumental features, such as
        the edges of the
        <a href="/about/instruments.html#ACIS">ACIS detectors</a>,
        as shown in this

       This shows the 
       <a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/dss/">STScI Digitized Sky Survey</a>
       image of the sky surrounding the target.
       These images are scans of observations of the night sky made
       with small (for modern standard) telescopes using
       photographic plates; they therefore represent a good
       representation of the night sky you would see if your
       eyes were <em>extremely</em> sensitive.
       Please see the 
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digitized_Sky_Survey">Wikipedia
	 article on Digitized Sky Surveys</a> for more information.

     </div>

     <p>
       Here we show two DSS images: the first is an ACIS-S imaging-mode
       observation of the
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globular_cluster">Globular Cluster</a>
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_22">M22</a>.
       The aim point of the telescope is shown by the red cross and the
       six squares labelled 0 to 5 show the locations of the
       <a href="instruments.html#ACIS-S">ACIS-S chips</a>
       during the observation (the orientation is determined by the choice of
       aim point and the roll angle of the spacecraft during the
       observation). The four chips in a two-by-two arrangement to the
       left of the ACIS-S array shows the location of the
       <a href="instruments.html#ACIS-I">ACIS-I array</a>
       chips during the observation. The choice of chips that
       are turned on during an observation is made by the observer:
       for this observation they are the central four ACIS-S
       chips (labelled as 1 to 4 in red), although the outer two
       (labelled with green numerals) are optional and may be
       turned off if observational constraints require it.
     </p>

     <p>
       The second is an ACIS-I imaging-mode observation of the
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_31">Andromeda
       Galaxy (also known as M31)</a>. In this case the aim point is
       on the <a href="instruments.html#ACIS-I">ACIS-I array</a> and
       two of the ACIS-S array chips (ACIS-S2 and ACIS-S3) may also
       be turned on.
     </p>
     
     <p>
       Also labelled are the stars used to keep track of the telescope
       pointing during an observation (the
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guide_star">Guide Stars</a>)
       and those stars used after the telescope slew to ensure that
       the field has been correctly identified (the acquisition stars).
     </p>

     <p>
       Additional labels and rectangles may be drawn for more complicated
       observations, such as those using only a fraction of a chip - the
       "sub-array mode" - in order to observer very bright sources.
     </p>

     <p>
       The labels 
       <span class="labels">YOFF</span>,
       <span class="labels">ZOFF</span>,
       <span class="labels">ZSIM</span>,
       and
       <span class="labels">ACIS PB</span> <!-- TODO: HRC obs -->
       indicate parameter values used in the observation, such 
       as the location of the instrument bench which holds
       the ACIS and HRC detectors.

       This shows the 
       <a href="http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/rosat/rass.html">ROSAT All Sky Survey data</a>
       available for the area.
       This survey was made by the
       ROSAT satellite - a German-led mission - which 
       covered 
       <a href="http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/cgi-bin/rosat/rosat-survey">virtually all the sky</a>
       using an
       X-ray imaging detector. This detector
       was only sensitive to "soft" X-rays -
       roughly 0.1 to 2.5 keV - and had a significantly
       larger
       <abbr title="Point Spread Function">PSF</abbr>
       than Chandra.
     </p>

     <div class="fov">

     </div>

     <p>
       The RASS view shows the same outline as the DSS image, but
       does not include the location of the stars used for
       acquisition and monitoring (they are generally not strong
       X-ray emitters). It is not uncommon to be unable to make out
       an X-ray source in the RASS data at the aim point of the Chandra observation,
       as it is in the M22 case. M31 is a bright X-ray source and so
       is seen in the RASS.

       This view shows the ROSAT 
       <abbr title="Position Sensitive Proportional Counter">PSPC</abbr>
       data available
       for the area, taken from the "pointed
       phase" of the Observatory's lifetime.
       Since this did not cover the whole sky,
       regions may contain no data, or the
       data only partly covers the image.
       if present, the data is generally of 
       "higher quality" than the All-Sky-Survey
       data since the observation times are generally
       significantly longer than, and the 
       <abbr title="Point Spread Function">PSF</abbr>
       size is slightly smaller than, the 
       <abbr title="ROSAT All Sky Survey">RASS</abbr>.
     </p>

     <div class="fov">
       <img width="340" alt="PSPC view of M22 with the field of view of ACIS-S drawn on top." src="http://asc.harvard.edu/targets/401442/401442.14609.soe.pspc.gif">
       <img width="340" alt="PSPC view of M31 with the field of view of ACIS-I drawn on top." src="http://asc.harvard.edu/targets/601138/601138.16294.soe.pspc.gif">

     <p>
       In this case there were two PSPC observations of the
       M22 field, one centered on M22 and one wich just overlapped
       it to the right. Both observations were significantly
       longer than the RASS observation - shown by the larger
       number of counts in the background and the fact that
       some sources can just be seen near M22 
       that are not obvious in the RASS data. As with Chandra,
       PSPC observations have a spatially-varying PSF; as you 
       move further from the center of the observation, the
       PSF increases (this does not happen for the RASS observations
       due to the way those observations were taken). This
       can be seen by viewing the source seen in both the RASS
       and PSPC images; it is far off axis in the PSPC case which
       means its PSF is larger, and shows more structure,
       than if it were on axis.
       <!-- Not sure where I am going with this -->
     </p>

     <p>
       The area around M31 was covered by many PSPC observations, and
       you can make out the emission from the halo of the galaxy as
       well as some of the point sources; these are mostly
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_binary">X-ray
       binaries</a>
       in the galaxy, but some may be background

       Galactic Nuclei (AGN)</a>.

     <p>
       This is a
       <a
       href='http://chandra.harvard.edu/edu/formal/age_snr/3color_ds9.html'>three-color
       image</a>
       of M31 from a single six and a half
       hour ACIS-I observation, taken by Chandra in December 2006,
       as part of a
       <a
       href="http://cda.cfa.harvard.edu/chaser/startViewer.do?menuItem=propAbstract&obsid=7064">program
       to study Black Hole X-ray Nova</a>. The green squares show the
       location of the four ACIS-I and two ACIS-S chips that were
       turned on for the observation (the roll angle of the satellite
       was different from that of the M31 observation shown above).
       Many more point sources are seen than in the PSPC data, due
       to the significantly greater spatial resolution of Chandra, 
       and the wider pass band (roughly 0.5 to 7 keV rather than 0.5
       to 2.5 keV) means that we have some information on the spectra
       of these sources, shown by the colors in this image:
       red sources are "soft", with most of their emission below about
       1.2 keV (the hot gas created by supernovae and the formation of
       the galaxy is predominantly red);
       green sources have most of their emission between 1.2
       and 2 keV;
       blue sources are "hard", with most of their emission
       above 2 keV; and other colors are due to mixtures of these.
       M31 has been observed many times by Chandra - since it is a
       nearby galaxy - leading to many
       <a href='http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2013/m31/'>exciting
       discoveries about its black-hole population</a>.

       This shows an optical image of the sky - like the DSS version above

       shown in the DSS/RASS/PSPC views: it does not account for the
       exact positioning of the instrument in the focal plane of the
       telescope and - for ACIS - only shows either the ACIS-S or
       ACIS-I array.
       The red lines at the bottom of the image show the nearest
