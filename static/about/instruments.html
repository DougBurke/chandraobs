   <h1>Instruments on the Chandra X-Ray Observatory</h1>

   <p><strong>TODO:</strong> add example images.</p>

   <p>
     There are two detectors on Chandra - 
     <a href="#ACIS">ACIS</a> and <a href="#HRC">HRC</a> -
     that can be used either with or without
     one of the two grating arrays:
     <a href="#LETG">LETG</a> or <a href="#HETG">HETG</a>.
     The ACIS and HRC instruments are mounted on 
     the <abbr title="Science Instrument Module">SIM</abbr>,
     which can be moved to place either of them at the 
     focal plane of the telescope (for some observations -
     mostly for calibration but sometimes when extremely bright
     sources are being observed - the instrument is moved
     so that the instrument is not at the center of the
     focal plane; the instruments can also be placed in
     a safe position, shielded by the rest of the telescope,
     when the particle background is high).
     The gratings are mounted behind the Chandra mirrors,
     and can be inserted into the light path when needed.
   </p>

   <p>
     As a rule of thumb, the instruments are used for
     the following science cases:
   </p>

   <dl>
    <dt>Observing many sources or a large source</dt>
    <dd>
     <p>
      The ACIS-I array is often used because of its size
      and energy resolution. The HRC-I array covers a larger
      area, but is less sensitive and has very-limited
      spectral resolution.
     </p>
    </dd>

    <dt>High spectral resolution of bright sources</dt>
    <dd>
     <p>
      For those sources where high spectral resolution is required,
      a grating is used. Although any grating can be used with
      any instrument, the following two combinations are preferred,
      since they provide the best performance:
      HRC-I with the LETG or ACIS-S with the HETG.
     </p>
    </dd>

    <dt>High spectral resolution of faint sources</dt>
    <dd>
     <p>
      As using gratings reduces the efficiciency of the
      telescope, they are not used with faint sources.
      In this situation the common option is to use
      ACIS-S with no grating.
     </p>
    </dd>

    <dt>High spatial resolution</dt>
    <dd>
     <p>
      The HRC-I is used when spatial resolution
      is important.
     </p>
    </dd>

   </dl>

   <p>
     There are specialized modes of operation
     possible, such as <abbr title="Continuous Clocking">CC</abbr>
     mode, which continuously reads out the ACIS chips to greatly
     improve the time resolution but at the loss of 1 dimension
     of imaging data, or using a sub-array to read out only a
     subset of a chip.
     These are not commonly used, as they
     require specific conditions - normally a very-bright source -
     and so are not described further here.
   </p>

   <h2 id="ACIS">ACIS</h1>

   <p>
     The <abbr title=" Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer">ACIS</abbr> instrument
     on the Chandra X-ray Observatory
     contains 10
     <abbr title="Charge Coupled Devices">CCDs</abbr>
     arranged into two shapes (4 and 6 chips).
     Although there is a great deal of flexibility in which chips
     can used in an observation - due to telemetry limits
     only a maximum of 6 chips could be used
     at the start of the mission and this has now dropped to
     5 due to thermal constraints
     - observations with ACIS are split into two categories:
     ACIS-I and ACIS-S.
   </p>
   <p>
     Of the ten chips, eight of them
     are front illuminated (FI), with the remaining two
     - both in the ACIS-S array - being back illuminated (BI).
     The general characteristics of the two different types of
     chip are the same - that is pixel size (0.492 arcsecond
     square) and number of pixels (1024 by 1024) - with the
     main differences being:
   </p>

   <dl>
    <dt>energy resolution</dt>
    <dd>
     <p>
      At launch the BI chips had higher spectral resolution -
      that is they were better at distinguishing between
      X-ray photons with similar wavelengths. 
      This means that observing a source with a BI chip
      is likely to lead to a more accurate model for
      sources with a lot of structure - such as line
      emission - in their spectra.
      However, the difference
      in resolution between the BI and FI chips has decreased
      with time due to radiation damage during the early
      part of the observation.
     </p>
    </dd>

    <dt>sensitivity</dt>
    <dd>
     <p>
      The BI chips are more sensitive at low energies (below about
      1 keV), which means that they are often used for observing
      "softer" sources: X-ray astronomers use the term "soft" to mean
      sources with most of their emission at low energies (longer
      wavelength) and
      "hard" for sources with more emission at high energies (shorter
      wavelengths),
      in a similar manner to how optical astronomers use
      the terms "red" and "blue".
     </p>
    </dd>

    <dt>background level</dt>
    <dd>
     <p>
       The background counts detected by the BI chips - which is a
       combination of instrumental, particle, and cosmic components - 
       is higher than that of the FI chips in the same observation.
     </p>
    </dd>
   </dl>

   <p>
    The standard mode of operating the ACIS chips is to read them out
    every 3.4 seconds. The combination of source flux and instrument
    sensitivity means that most pixels do not detect any counts in
    each readout period, which means that when we detect a count
    we can generally assume it represents a single photon.
    An estimate of the energy of the incoming photon is found
    by measuring the amount of electrons in the pixel (the "count").
    If the source is bright enough then there is the possibility of
    detecting two or more counts in a single readout; this is
    referred to as "pile up" and results in strange behavior
    (the source spectrum is artificially hardened - i.e. it contains
     more high-energy counts than it should - and in the most
     extreme cases images of the source become "cratered",
     as the counts in the center of the source are lost).
     One way to detect the presence of a bright source is to look
     for "read out streaks": since there is no shutter on the
     ACIS cameras, the detectors are still taking data during the
     time it takes to read out a frame (this read out time is
     about 0.04 seconds) which causes the whole column
     to contain extra counts.
   </p>

   <h3 id="ACIS-I">ACIS-I</h2>

   <p>
     The ACIS-I array contains four chips arranged into a square.
     Since each chip is 8 arcminutes square, the ACIS-I array
     covers a square 16 arcminutes on a side (the orientation
     depends on the roll-angle of the telescope at the time
     of the observation). All four chips are front illuminated (FI),
     and are referred to as ACIS-I0 to ACIS-I3 or ACIS-0 to ACIS-3.
     This set up is optimised for imaging experiments, and is
     rarely used with a <a href="#grating">grating</a>.
   </p>

   <h3 id="ACIS-S">ACIS-S</h2>

   <p>
     The ACIS-S array contains 6 chips in a single row, so
     it is 8 arcminutes wide by 36 arcminutes long. The full
     array of chips is generally only used with the 
     <a href="#HETG">HETG grating</a>, but the central
     chip (known as ACIS-S3 or ACIS-7) is often used
     for imaging observations (i.e. with no grating), since
     it is a back-illuminated (BI) chip.
     The ACIS-S chips are referred to as ACIS-S0 to ACIS-S5
     or ACIS-4 to ACIS-9.
   </p>

   <h2 id="HRC">HRC</h1>

   <p>
    The <abbr title="High Resolution Camera">HRC</abbr> instrument 
    on the Chandra X-ray Observatory contains
    Micro Channel Plates that detect X-ray photons
    by ... <strong>TODO: finish this!</strong>
   </p>

   <h3 id="HRC-I">HRC-I</h2>

   <p>
     This detector is used when either the largest field of view
     (30 by 30 arcminutes) or the highest spatial resolution
     is required.
   </p>

   <h3 id="HRC-S">HRC-S</h2>

   <p>
     This detector is primarily used with the
     <a href="#LETG">LETG</a> spectrometer.
   </p>

   <h1 id="grating">The Chandra gratings</h1>

   <p>
    While the ACIS chips have some energy resolution - provided by
    measuring the number of electrons in each "count" - the highest
    spectral resolution is provided by the grating arrays. When used,
    one of the two arrays is moved into the light path behind the mirrors 
    and the light is diffracted by the transmission gratings in the array
    onto the detector (normally either ACIS-S or HRC-S).
    Since the light has been diffracted, the location of the count on the
    detector can be used to determine the energy - or wavelength - of the
    incoming photon. The gratings provide an energy resolution of
    approximately one part in a thousand.
   </p>

   <h2 id="LETG">LETG</h2>

   <p>
    The <abbr title="Low Energy Transmission Grating">LETG</abbr> spectrometer
    contains regularly-spaced wires of gold and are designed for observing
    sources in the 0.08 to 2 keV energy range, or 6 to 150 Angstroms.
    The LETG is primarily used with the HRC-S.
   </p>

   <h2 id="HETG">HETG</h2>

   <p>
    The <abbr title="High Energy Transmission Grating">HETG</abbr> spectrometer
    contains two gratings, arranged at different angles so that the dispersed
    spectra form an "X" pattern on the detector, which is normally ACIS-S.
    The gratings are also made of gold but with much smaller spacings between
    the wires, so that the energy range covered is 0.4 to 8 keV, or
    to 1.5 to 30 Angstroms.
