   <p class="caveat">
     This web site is <em>not</em> an official product of
     the Chandra X-ray Center. The information provided here

    The Chandra X-ray Observatory - hereafter Chandra - is
    one of NASA's four great observatories, the other three
    being:
    the <a href="http://hubblesite.org/">Hubble Space Telescope</a>;
    the <a href="http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/cgro/">Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory</a>;
    and the
    <a href="http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/">Spitzer Space Telescope</a>.
    It is orbit around the Earth and taking observations, commanded
    by the Chandra X-ray Center based on proposals made by
    professional Astronomers. This site aims to tell you
    what observation Chandra is performing now, and provide
    some context for what it is doing.
