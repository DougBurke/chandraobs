   <h1>What is the 'What is Chandra doing now?' site?</h1>

   <p class="caveat">
     This web site is <em>not</em> an official product of
     the Chandra X-ray Center. The information provided here
     is provided for educational purposes but should not be
     relied on.
     It is also <strong>not complete</strong> at this time,
     since this is a <em>test</em> site.
   </p>

   <p>
    The Chandra X-ray Observatory - hereafter Chandra - is
    one of NASA's four great observatories, the other three
    being:
    the <a href="http://hubblesite.org/">Hubble Space Telescope</a>;
    the <a href="http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/cgro/">Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory</a>;
    and the
    <a href="http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/">Spitzer Space Telescope</a>.
    It is orbit around the Earth and taking observations, commanded
    by the Chandra X-ray Center based on proposals made by
    professional Astronomers. This site aims to tell you
    what observation Chandra is performing now, and provide
    some context for what it is doing.
   </p>

   <p>
     For science observations, information on the target, the
     reason for observing the target (the abstract of the
     proposal), and 
     <a href="views.html">a variety of views</a> of the
     target are given. Chandra also regularly performs
     sets of calibration observations, which are
     indicated as such, and have no science abstract or
     imaging data.
     There are times when Chandra is not taking data,
     either because the orbit of Chandra is taking it through
     the 
     <a href="http://www-spof.gsfc.nasa.gov/Education/Iradbelt.html">radiation
       belts around Earth</a> - in which case the 
     instruments are moved out of the focal plane of
     the telescope to prevent radiation damage - or
     because the telescope has to change its direction
     to point to a new target. This latter case is known as
     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slew_%28spacecraft%29">slewing</a>
     and for Chandra this is a slow process,
     since it is a large, heavy, spacecraft and so fast moves would
     make it harder to obtain the pointing accuracy needed 
     to maximise the high spatial resolution of the telescope.
     This is in contrast to some missions, such as 
     <a href="http://swift.gsfc.nasa.gov/about_swift/">the Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Mission</a>,
     which is designed to be able to 
     <a href="http://swift.gsfc.nasa.gov/help/swiftfaq.html#slew">slew very quickly</a>.

    The tour functionality provided on the
    <a href="/index.html">main page</a> is provided by the
    <a href="http://bootstraptour.com/">Bootstrap Tour</a>
    JavaScript library, and I took "inspiration" for this
    feature from the
    <a href="http://adslabs.org/adsabs/">ADS Labs search page</a>.
    The table sorting on the <a href="/schedule/index.html">Schedule page</a>
    is done by the 
    <a href="http://tablesorter.com/docs/">TableSorter jQuery plugin</a>.
    The web site is coded in
    <a href="http://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a>,
    and I plan to make the code available at some point in the
    near future,
    and runs thanks to
    one of the
    <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">free plans on Heroku</a>.
