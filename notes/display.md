# Thoughts on web display

 - a view of the object types II: give some statisics on the
   object types that have been observed (broken down by time
   or AO; the latter is harder and I don't think as interesting
   to the public)

 - some form of a calendar widget to jump through the schedule;
   how about a day view (a simple condensed view of what it's
   doing), perhaps also week and/or month.

 - add in object type and proposal area to the schedule list

 - add in proposal area to the main display

 - Can we display on sources from the CSC in WWT? The HTML5 WWT
   API has some mention of a display VoTable routine.

 - Can the WWT view display more controls/fade over between bands/
   labels/the cross hair menu thingy

 - ADS view of papers about this object/class of object/...
   by this PI

   note that the page on SIMBAD that we link to (when
   available) includes papers about the source

 - archive link to existing Chandra data

 - display constellation name

 - can we have a simple view showing Earth/Moon(?)/orbit and
   path during osbservation; for ongoing obs perhaps even the
   position of Chandra within the orbit and its direction?

 - a simple search box - name, prob not a cone search?
   also: view all HRC-I obs/... page?

 - in the schedule view, show the region of the sky that is
   inaccessible (roll angle + .. constraints)

Doing

 - a view of the object types I: for a given object type
   display a schedule-like page showing the observations;
   this could get hairy once the database fills up.

Done

 - observation abstract: have now a link to the archive version of
   the abstract, but presentation on this site needs to be
   improved, and it would be nice to provide a more-friendly
   landing page. I have an initial version up.

 - information on the target (e.g. wikipedia) since I think
   NED/SIMBAD would be a bit too much. Actually, trying out
   a SIMBAD search; perhaps should include positional information
   in the search (definitely need to protect/hide characters in
   the name). For now limited to basic SIMBAD information.

 - a condensed version of the observation schedule, with some form
   of pagination
   
 - a 'tour this page' option a la the ADS 
   http://adslabs.org/adsabs/search/
     -> http://bootstraptour.com/
