# Thoughts on web display

 - Can we display on sources from the CSC in WWT?

 - Can the WWT view display more controls/fade over between bands/
   labels/the cross hair menu thingy

 - observation abstract: have now a link to the archive version of
   the abstract, but presentation on this site needs to be
   improved, and it would be nice to provide a more-friendly
   landing page

 - information on the target (e.g. wikipedia) since I think
   NED/SIMBAD would be a bit too much

 - ADS view of papers about this object/class of object/...
   by this PI

 - archive link to existing Chandra data
