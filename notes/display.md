# Thoughts on web display

 - Can we display on sources from the CSC in WWT?

 - Can the WWT view display more controls/fade over between bands/
   labels/the cross hair menu thingy

 - observation abstract: have now a link to the archive version of
   the abstract, but presentation on this site needs to be
   improved, and it would be nice to provide a more-friendly
   landing page

 - information on the target (e.g. wikipedia) since I think
   NED/SIMBAD would be a bit too much. Actually, trying out
   a SIMBAD search; perhaps should include positional information
   in the search (definitely need to protect/hide characters in
   the name).

 - ADS view of papers about this object/class of object/...
   by this PI

 - archive link to existing Chandra data

 - display constellation name

 - can we have a simple view showing Earth/Moon(?)/orbit and
   path during osbservation; for ongoing obs perhaps even the
   position of Chandra within the orbit and its direction?

 - a simple search box - name, prob not a cone search?
   also: view all HRC-I obs/... page?

 - a 'tour this page' option a la the ADS 
   http://adslabs.org/adsabs/search/
     -> http://bootstraptour.com/
