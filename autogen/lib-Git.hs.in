-- | This is an indication of what version of the code is being used.
--   It is not guaranteed to be correct for development builds, as
--   it only uses the git hash of the last commit. It really should
--   be an IO action, in that it is not guaranteed to be constant
--   between builds, but for now I leave it as below, since it is constant
--   within a build.
