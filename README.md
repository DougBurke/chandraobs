# The 'What is Chandra doing now' web site

I have long wanted to have a public-oriented page that tells
people what the [Chandra X-ray Observatory](http://chandra.harvard.edu/)
is currently doing: is it slewing between observations, observing
a science target, or [hunkering down, to avoid a passing metoer shower](http://chandra.harvard.edu/blog/node/500).

This is my experiment at creating a web site that does just that, and
I hope to explore how much extra content I can add to enrich the site,
such as links to press articles about the object being observerd or
discussions of the X-ray properties of the class of object being
observed.

This is *not* an official product of the 
[Chandra X-ray Center](http://cxc.harvard.edu/), and I make no guaranteed
about the accuracy of the material being presented: this is in part
because I am yet to hook into an accurate representation of the 
observation commands sent to Chandra, but is also because
Chandra is an autonomous observatory, and has the ability to go
into ["safe mode" if it detects anomalous conditions](http://chandra.harvard.edu/about/spacecraft.html).
