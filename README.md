# The 'What is Chandra doing now' web site

I have long wanted to have a public-oriented page that tells
people what the [Chandra X-ray Observatory](http://chandra.harvard.edu/)
is currently doing: is it slewing between observations, observing
a science target, or [hunkering down, to avoid a passing metoer shower](http://chandra.harvard.edu/blog/node/500).

Well, [here it is!](http://chandraobs-devel.herokuapp.com/) This
might take time to load up the first time you go to it, because it
goes to sleep if the server has been inactive for too long.
It is my experiment at creating a web site that does just that, and
I hope to explore how much extra content I can add to enrich the site,
such as links to press articles about the object being observered or
discussions of the X-ray properties of the class of object being
observed.

This is *not* an official product of the 
[Chandra X-ray Center](http://cxc.harvard.edu/), and I make no guaranteed
about the accuracy of the material being presented: this is in part
because I am yet to hook into an accurate representation of the 
observation commands sent to Chandra, but is also because
Chandra is an autonomous observatory, and has the ability to go
into ["safe mode" if it detects anomalous conditions](http://chandra.harvard.edu/about/spacecraft.html).
